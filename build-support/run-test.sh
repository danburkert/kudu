# If KUDU_COMPRESS_TEST_OUTPUT is non-empty, then the logs will be
# gzip-compressed while they are written.
#
# If KUDU_FLAKY_TEST_ATTEMPTS is non-zero, and the test being run matches
# one of the lines in the file KUDU_FLAKY_TEST_LIST, then the test will
# be retried on failure up to the specified number of times. This can be
# used in the gerrit workflow to prevent annoying false -1s caused by
# tests that are known to be flaky in master.
#
# If KUDU_REPORT_TEST_RESULTS is non-zero, then tests are reported to the
# central test server.
